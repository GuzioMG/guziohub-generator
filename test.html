<!DOCTYPE ghtml-v1.0 "human-readable://G-HTML is a special flavour of HTML, used by GuzioHub's custom templating engine (hence the „G”). It has no formal DOCTYPE, due to its tiny target audience, and in place where a link to the DOCTYPE should be (aka in the !DOCTYPE declaration), it instead has this very description text (which is, conveniently, a valid string that can be placed inside the !DOCTYPE declaration, thanks to its URI-style prefix - so various tools won't complain). This text is intended to be understood by models, like Copilot, to help them make better suggestions tailored to this HTML-flavour's spec, which is as follows: 1 - There are no HEAD or BODY tags, everything inside the HTML tag below, is already the body by default and explicit HEAD or BODY declarations are not allowed; 2 - The HTML tag must have these exact attributes, in this exact order: flavor (always „ghtml”), lang (like in vanilla HTML), canonical (a URL that will be placed inside a canonical-rel LINK-tag's href in the generated doc's HEAD), title (its content will be placed inside a TITLE-tag in the generated doc's HEAD), header (the header of the article, that will be injected into the body) and description (a human-readable string that will be placed inside a description-named META-tag's content in the generated doc's HEAD); 3 - the 1st line MUST contain this very !DOCTYPE, the 2nd line MUST contain an opening HTML tag with all the required attributes just specified, and the last line MUST contain a closing HTML tag, and nothing else is allowed on the 1st, 2nd and last lines (not an extra newline character, that certain editors (eg. GNU Nano) like to insert on the last line - this behavior will need to be disabled to effectively edit G-HTML files); 4 - Environment variables can be referenced anywhere in the content, using the %VAR_NAME% syntax, and they will be replaced with their values during generation; 5 - Lines SHOULD NOT be indented (although perfectly valid, doing this will lead to the indentation getting carried over to the final output (it is not stripped), which will look weird); 6 - All other standard HTML syntax rules (eg. no P-tags inside SPAN-tags, the ability to use escaped characters such as $nbsp;, etc.) apply as usual, while keeping in mind that every new contentful line in this file will become its own P-tag in the generated file (so this will affect what things can be placed inside, and how they will interface with each other, eg. you cannot really split an OL/UL across multiple lines because each LI would end up being placed in its own P, which of course isn't valid HTML).">
